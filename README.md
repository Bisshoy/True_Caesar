This is a program that allows the user to input a string of any length. 
The user will also choose a shift value. The program will shift the 
letters of the user's original sentence by a number equal to the shift 
value. For example, if the entered message is abcde and the shift value
is 2, then the cyphered text is cdefg. 
This program also includes a decypher option; for this, input the same 
shift value as the original; no extra work needs to be done. If the 
original text was cyphered with a shift value of 5, then to decypher it,
the user should input 5 at the prompt as well. 
[NOTE: The formula for the decode shift is: 26 - (shift % 26)]
